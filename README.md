# ZFM - Arduino based FM synth using Mozzi library

### What's this?

Arduino based FM Synth using the Mozzi library

Note that I used [https://platformio.org](Platformio) for the development of this sketch but you can upload it using the standard Arduino development environment as well. Just create a new sketch, copy the contents of [https://github.com/peterzimon/ZFM/blob/master/src/main.cpp](this file) to it and you should be good to go.

### How does it sound?
